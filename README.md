# auto-typewriter
An automated script to clear exercises on the website https://at4.typewriter.at. \
Many austrian schools seem to use this website. I made this to help a friend out.

### Usage
First, enter the amount of keypresses you would like to achieve within 10 minutes. \
Next, some JS code will be generated and copied to your clipboard. \
Open up the website and open a lesson page (**[example](https://at4.typewriter.at/index.php?r=typewriter/startPractise&id=1083)**). \
Open up Dev Tools, navigate to Console and paste the code from your clipboard. \
Run the code, focus the page again within 3 seconds and let the program run.
